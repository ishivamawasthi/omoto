						This is a sample survey design for us to visualise how the welcome page on the survey would look like. The welcome text could be as big as a paragraph like this or it could be just a couple of lines. The design must be minimalist and would focus on the use of great typeface to create beautiful design. Of course, the colour and theme is configurable.
